Play my React.js Checkers App
URL: https://shanetracey7.github.io/reacttestapp/

Purpose:
This was made to expand and apply my React.js knowledge. I took an online code academy course on React.js to gain a base understanding before starting this project.

What it does:
It is a checkers App, if your not familiar with the game, you can find more about it at the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers

There are 2 game modes: Human vs. Computer (1-player) and Human vs. Human (2-player).

Human vs. Computer (1-player):
For this, the user will play the algorithm I made to play checkers and select their desired level of difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard.

Human vs. Human (2-player):
For this, the user needs an extra person to play, as this is not online multiplayer. Both users will need to be present to input their moves from the same computer.
If a player cannot move any of their pieces, they will simply have to use the "skip" button to skip their turn and they can continue playing.


Once the game has completed, the user will have to click the back button to go back to the menu, to play again. There they can change the game mode, if they desire.
